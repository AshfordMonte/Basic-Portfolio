      <p>Hello! My name is Monte Ashford, but you can call me Gage. I am a student at Texas State University pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
        I was raised around technology, and I have used computers for as long as I can remember. My interest in video games soon expanded to include
        all things tech and I actively keep up with new developments in Computer Science. Recently, I've begun studying/practicing web development
        in order to learn more about how we access the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy other hobbies such as: playing bass guitar, tennis, and learning about history. I am a huge music fan
        and some of my favorite bands include: 'Black Sabbath', 'Rush', 'Yes', 'CCR', and 'The Who' just to name a few!
